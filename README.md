# DCM heart tissue RNASeq/miRNASeq analysis
## University of Kentucky Biobank collaboration: WES, miRNASeq, and RNASeq analysis of non ischemic cardiomyopathy heart tissue from 18 HT patients + 5 controls

**Goal:** Integrate WES and miRNASeq data with multiple RNASeq analyses (variant calling, pathogenic splice site identification, allelic imbalance, differential expression) to gain functional insight into mechanism of CM in cohort, with a particular focus on the gene TTN. RNASeq and miRNASeq analysis performed here. 

## Overall analyses:
  1. RNASeq variant calling - `AllelicImbalanceAnalysis.Rmd`
  2. Pathogenic splice site identification and analysis - `Junction Analysis.Rmd`
  3. Allelic imbalance analysis - `AllelicImbalanceAnalysis.Rmd`
  4. Differential expression- group comparisons informed by first 3 analyses - `RNASeq_miRNASeq_Analysis.Rmd`
  5. miRNASeq differential expression and integration with RNASeq - `RNASeq_miRNASeq_Analysis.Rmd`
  
 ***Detailed explanation of each analysis provided in readme contained in each folder.***
 
 
 *Note: WES analysis and filtration performed prior to RNASeq. Results incorporated into this analysis, but the WES filtration strategy not included in this repository.*
