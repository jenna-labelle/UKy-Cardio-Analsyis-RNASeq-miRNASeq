# UKy_RNASeq
## University of Kentucky Biobank collaboration: analysis of dilated cardiomyopathy heart tissue from 18 HT patients + 5 controls

Whole exome sequencing, RNASeq, and miRNASeq performed

RNASeq and miRNASeq analysis performed here, integrated with WES

## Overall analyses:
  1. RNASeq variant calling + comparison to WES
  2. Pathogenic splice site identification and analysis
  3. Allelic imbalance analysis
  4. Differential expression- group comparisons informed by first 3 analyses
  5. miRNASeq differential expression and integration with RNASeq
