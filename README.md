# UKy_RNASeq
## University of Kentucky Biobank collaboration: WES, miRNASeq, and RNASeq analysis of non ischemic cardiomyopathy heart tissue from 18 HT patients + 5 controls

**Goal:** Integrate WES and miRNASeq data with multiple RNASeq analyses (variant calling, pathogenic splice site identification, allelic imbalance, differential expression) to gain functional insight into mechanism of CM in cohort, with a particular focus on the gene TTN

RNASeq and miRNASeq analysis performed here, integrated with WES results

## Overall analyses:
  1. RNASeq variant calling + comparison to WES ("Variant Analysis")
  2. Pathogenic splice site identification and analysis ("Junction Analysis")
  3. Allelic imbalance analysis ("Variant Analysis")
  4. Differential expression- group comparisons informed by first 3 analyses
  5. miRNASeq differential expression and integration with RNASeq
  
 ***Detailed explanation of each analysis provided in readme contained in each folder.***
